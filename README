# Default connecting to localhost interface on port 27017 - MongoClient("mongodb://mongodb0.example.net:27017")

Run.py represents a python3 implementation of a minimal reverse proxy for the NextBus API.
By creating a python web server (listening in port 80), the program receives GET requests from a user
and forwards it to the NextBus API - if the request is not already cached in a local Redis server -.
The application also has an endpoint path (/stats) to show statistics (slow_requests and queries) which are stored in a
Mongo database.

Libraries:

- http.server: To create a web server.
- requests: For external http GET requests to NextBus API.
- requests_cache: To store requests in cache.
- Pymongo: Driver to use Mongo database.
- json: To return data in json format.

Dependecies:

- pip3 install redis
- pip3 install requests
- pip3 install requests_cache
- pip3 install pymongo
